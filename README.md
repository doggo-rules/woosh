# Woo Shell

### About Woo Shell
Woo Shell (woosh) is a shell written in Rust. It is made to be simple yet easy to configure<sup>[1](#footnote-1)</sup>.

<b id="footnote-1">[1]</b> The shell has no configuration yet. There will be one added in the future but the shell is still in a really early stage and adding a config would just make it slower for me to make changes easily.
